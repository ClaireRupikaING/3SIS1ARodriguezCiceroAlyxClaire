AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 
I have walked among men and angels for 3,000 years.
Time has no end, no beginning, no purpose.
I wandered the earth seeking forgiveness for my horrible crimes against God and man.
I live to see death and destruction.
Evil over the light, but the light cannot be extinguished.
I live in a prison of my own demise. I am lost in time.

I’ve come here from nowhere
Across the unforgiving sea
Drifting further and further
It’s all becoming clear to me
The violent winds are upon us and I can’t sleep
Internal temperatures rising
And all the voices won’t recede


I’ve finally found what I was looking for
A place where I can be without remorse
Because I am a stranger who has found
An even stranger war
I’ve finally found what I was looking for
Here I come (Come, come, come, come)
Here I come


La chaleur me dérange
Mais c’est le grincement du bateau qui m’a réveillée


I sharpen the knife
And look down upon the bay
For all of my life
A stranger I remain
A stranger I remain
A stranger I remain
