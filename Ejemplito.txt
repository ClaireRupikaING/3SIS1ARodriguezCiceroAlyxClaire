AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 
I have walked among men and angels for 3,000 years.
Time has no end, no beginning, no purpose.
I wandered the earth seeking forgiveness for my horrible crimes against God and man.
I live to see death and destruction.
Evil over the light, but the light cannot be extinguished.
I live in a prison of my own demise. I am lost in time.
